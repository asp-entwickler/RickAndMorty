# RickAndMorty


Your task will be to create a small application to display profile information of some characters from "Rick and Morty".

For this application we do see 3 main functionalities:

==Character listing==
- the list should contain the most important information about the characters
- the user should be able to explore the whole list of characters

==Character filtering==
- the user should be able to filter on status and gender

==Character details==
- selecting an item in the list would show details about the character

Technical details:
- you may get the character information from https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
- the application should be web based developed in a Framework of your choice.

- create Tickets in Github for bugs and improvements you may encounter (donâ€™t need to solve them)
